            <p> They are super cute looking.

                I love my female American Lab.

                They are really fun dogs if you like to be outside in the field, park, woods, yard, water, lake and play
                and be active. This is their bailiwick.They retrieve toys, frisbees, sticks, kongs, balls, objects. They
                really do! Thats actually very hardto train other breeds to do. They will swim to the middle of a large
                lake to retrieve. Th energy and naturally talented one, you can do field trials and agility, hunt tests
                and actual upland and lowland (pheasant and duck/geese) hunting if you want. Theyll flush and set up
                game birds in theer people and dogs( though in a “lovable, cute” way), so you have to
                work with and on that.</p>
